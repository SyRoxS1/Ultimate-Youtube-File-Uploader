This programs is used  to upload files to youtube, this is done by creating images containing the data of the the file then with all these images I can create a video then upload it to Youtube 

I did not have the original idea of it I saw it from https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch/tree/master/src but thought it could be improved by having the script show the files on youtube showed as files in the script and i added the fact that you can automaticaly add the video generated to the channel using youtube api ( 6 videos per days :'( , go check other branch for bypass using https://github.com/wanghaisheng/tiktoka-studio-uploader )
